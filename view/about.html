          <p>
            MPower is an adaptive power management system for Android based devices. 
            An adaptive power management system is a system able to exploit the Observe-Decide-Act loop to adapt to the current environmental situation and the specific device it has to optimize. In this process, also the user experience cannot be disregarded. The final outputs of our system will be user-specific power consumption profiles. 
            The system will be able to optimize the device power consumption based on the device characteristics, the environmental conditions and the user need. Those components have to be considered at the same time. 
            To reach this final goal, it is necessary to model the device power consumption on a component base, e.g, the wifi interface power consumption given its status and the amount of data that it is transferring. Once the model has been generated automatically for each type of device, it is possible to add the user experience to tune the previous generated model to adapt to the user specific needs. The feedback provided by the user is reported to the adaptive system that will tune its decisions accordingly. 
            To automatically build device-specific power consumption models, it is necessary to have a large dataset of data to work on.

      <h2>System Architecture</h2>
      <br>

      <p>One of the fundamental MPower features is the automatic generation of power models. The model generator is the core component in the system. It is used to evaluate the power consumption of the system in a certain state, it is constantly refined using the information retrieved from the user habits and the experience collected on the device and it is personalized for each user. Since it is impossible to retrieve data about the device power consumption in a static way (e.g., using a data acquisition instrument) due to the great amount of different de- vices running Android, it is necessary to generate completely customized models using real data.
      </p>

      <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="span12 pagination-centered"><img src="images/architecture.png"></div>
      </div>

      <p>As a consequence, the power consumption model is automatically built using the data collected from each different device, that are analyzed on an external server. In order to retrieve all these data, the first MPower version is focalized on data collection, to retrieve as many data as possible from different devices and users. This particular aspect, the data collection phase, is described in details in Section IV.
      When a new device registers into MPower, it will be equipped with a generic model. The model will be then refined using the data collected from the specific device. Models are built and refined on the external server that stores the previously retrieved data, but sent to the correct device to be used online. Knowing the model generated by the remote server, on the device it is now possible to use it to know the current system power consumption and its battery life expectation starting from the current conditions.<p>

      <h3>Registration</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Why do I need to login using Google? Will my password be saved?</p>
        <small>
          You need to register your phone to enable a secure data sending between your phone and our server. 
          Your password will not be saved, since the login/registration is performed by Google.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>What personal data are saved?</p>
        <small>
          We are saving just your email, your first name and your phone IMEI (the phone identifier) for identification purposes.
        </small>

      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Is MPower a free app? Are you thinking to sell it in the future?</p>
        <small>
          MPower is a university project lead by the NECSTLab@POLIMI. For this reason it is and will be a free app.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      </br>


      <h3>Supported devices</h3>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Is MPower available also for iOS, BlackBarry or Windows Phone?</p>
        <small>
          Nope. MPower started as (and still is) a university project. Android is the only choice if you are looking for an open source system that enable you to make all the experiments you need. Moreover, the other OS doesn't allow us to have all the intruments we neee like, for instance, backgound execution of processes.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Are you planning to port MPower on other platform in the future?</p>
        <small>
          We're sorry but we do not have any plan in this direction right now.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Data collection</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What data are collected?</p>
        <small>
          We are collecting data about your phone internal status.
          We'll NEVER collect any personal data, browser history, gps positions, cookies, or any other sort of tracking data.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The application is asking for a lot of permissions, why?</p>
        <small>
          We need a lot of permissions to read your phone internal status, but we are not modifying any behavior without your consent.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Where are my data stored?</p>
        <small>
          Daily data are stored on your SD card and are then compressed and encrypted before the sending, thous ensuring the security of the overall system.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      </br>


      <h3>Data sending</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Do I need to send data manually?</p>
        <small>
          It is not necessary, the app daily sends all stored data automatically, if a data connection is available.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>What is the purpose of the button "Send data now"?</p>
        <small>
          You can click on the send data now button if you want to force a data sending immediately.  This was done mainly for debug purposes and will probably be changed on later versions.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>When are the data sent?</p>
        <small>          
          Data are sent daily, whenever it is available a wifi connection.
        </small>
      </blockquote>      

      <blockquote>
        <p>I rarely connect to wifi, will my data get lost?</p>
        <small>
          No at all, after 2 days without a wifi connection available, data are sent over the mobile network (2G/3G). 
          If you don't want to use your mobile connection, you can disable this feature through the application preferences.
        </small>
      </blockquote>


      <blockquote>
        <p>I have pressed the "Send data now" button, but a message said "No data to send", why?</p>
        <small>
          It is only possible to send data related to previous days, not about the current day. 
          If the message "No data to send" appears, it means that the phone has automatically sent your previous data.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      </br>


      <h3>Security</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Are my data encrypted before they are sent?</p>
        <small>
          Yes, they are encrypted using an asymmetrical cryptographic algorithm to ensure that no data was being manipulated.
        </small>
      </blockquote>


      </br>

      <h3>Suggestions</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What type of suggestions can MPower propose?</p>
        <small>
          MPower issues a notification if wifi, or bluetooth or GPS is enabled but not in use.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Can I disable suggestions?</p>
        <small>
          Yes, in the application preferences it is possible to disable each type of suggestion separately.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Can I change the delay before a notification is shown?</p>
        <small>
          Sure, just enter the application preferences and change the delay time for each type of notification.
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      </br>

      <h3>Web site</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I have just sent my data, but they are not visible on the website, why?</p>
        <small>
          It is not an immediate process, data are elaborated at fixed times during the day. 
          If you happen to can't view your data even after several hours after the sending, please let us know (you need to be logged in before reporting an issue).
        </small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>On the website, can I see all the data that are I have sent?</p>
        <small>
          Yes, all your data are visible on the website, and only you are entitled to view them.
        </small>
